KNOWLEDGE
There are two types of inguinal hernia, direct and indirect, which are defined by their relationship to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct inguinal hernias occur medial to the inferior epigastric vessels when abdominal contents herniate through a weak spot in the fascia of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, which is formed by the transversalis fascia. Indirect inguinal hernias occur when abdominal contents protrude through the deep inguinal ring, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels;

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
Intramural hematoma (IMH) represents localized hemorrhage within the aortic media. Several methods for the formation of IMH have been proposed: 1) rupture of the vasa vasorum resulting in weakening of the aortic wall; 
2) spontaneous thrombosis of the false lumen of an aortic dissection; 
3) penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer induced by rupture of an intimal atherosclerotic plaque, allowing blood to gain access to the aortic media.

AORTA.IABP.CASES,"CASE STUDY:
Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) with tip located in the proximal descending aorta likely below the origin of the left subclavian artery.

CASE STUDY:
An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a long-balloon temporary circulatory assist device that is used to support the circulation. The balloon is approximately 26 cm long and is mounted on a catheter. The catheter is radiolucent while the catheter tip is visible as a 3 to 4 mm rectangular, radiopaque density.
Careful attention must be paid to look for landmarks to confirm appropriate positioning of the IABP. Its superior tip should be slightly distal to the adjacent carina (second to third intercostal space) to avoid occlusion of the left subclavian artery, and the entire balloon should lie above the renal arteries. 
Potential complications that may occur rarely are balloon rupture with air embolization, septicemia, and acute pancreatitis.

Consider catheter directed angiogram. No evidence of aortic dissection flap. 

CASE STUDY:
Intramural hematoma (IMH) represents localized hemorrhage within the aortic media. Several methods for the formation of IMH have been proposed: 1) rupture of the vasa vasorum resulting in weakening of the aortic wall; 2) spontaneous thrombosis of the false lumen of an aortic dissection; and 3) penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer induced by rupture of an intimal atherosclerotic plaque, allowing blood to gain access to the aortic media.{ENTER}{ENTER}It is unclear which mechanism predominates. Indeed, it is likely that all of the above mechanisms play some role in the development of IMH.{ENTER}

Both lungs with moderate symmetric ground-glass opacity and perilobular opacities involving all lobes. Findings compatible with vaping pulmonary injury if clinical findings correlate. Differential diagnosis includes hypersensitivity pneumonitis, giant cell interstitial pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia or other cause. 
Giant cell interstitial pneumonia attributed to vaping in a 49-year-old woman who presented with one to two years of worsening dyspnea. Axial CT images show relatively symmetric ground-glass opacity and perilobular opacities involving all lobes

CASE STUDY:
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Findings on CT include symmetric upper lung-predominant and midlung-predominant ground-glass opacity, poorly defined centrilobular nodules, and sometimes attenuation that suggests air trapping.
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Chest x-ray or CT alone is not enough to distinguish this condition from other causes of acute lung opacities such as aspiration, edema, or infection. However, patients with alveolar hemorrhage may be anemic, Henry and colleagues wrote. Bronchoalveolar lavage with """"persistent or increasingly bloody"""" samples can confirm the diagnosis of this condition.

CASE STUDY:
Acute eosinophilic pneumonia: Often secondary to first-time vape usage, increased use, a brand change, or the resumption of traditional smoking products, recent cases have been difficult to diagnose due to nonspecific manifestations and the absence of peripheral eosinophilia at the time of presentation.
Organizing pneumonia: This is characterized by fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition, and typical CT findings are bilateral patchy ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or both in peripheral or perilobular distribution, according to the researchers.

CASE STUDY:
Lipoid pneumonia: Juices are the main flavoring agents for electronic nicotine delivery systems, but ingredients such as glycerin can cause endogenous phospholipidosis. """"The presence of lipid-laden macrophages on bronchoalveolar lavage or foreign body reaction around lipid at histology can confirm diagnosis,"""" the group wrote.
Giant cell interstitial pneumonia: Hard metal contamination of vaping aerosols is well documented, the authors noted. They encountered one case of this rare pneumonia, which was due to trace amounts of cobalt in the patient's vape mechanism.

RECTAL.CANCER.RADS,"TNM staging
See TNM staging system for a general description, and this article lists the various abbreviations used in rectal cancer staging.

Primary tumor staging (T)
Strictly speaking TNM staging, such as the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition, does not subclassify T3. However, this subclassification does have the treatment and prognostic significance 7,8; tumors with a stage T3b or less confer a 5-year cancer-specific survival rate of 85%%, whereas tumors with a stage T3c or greater have a 54%% survival rate.

Tx: primary tumor cannot be assessed

T0: no evidence of primary tumor

Tis: carcinoma in situ: intraepithelial or invasion of lamina propria

T1: tumor invades submucosa

T2: tumor invades muscularis propria

MRI does not yet have the resolution capable of enabling differentiation of T1 and T2 lesions

T3: tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the subserosa or into non-peritonealised perirectal tissues without reaching the mesorectal fascia or adjacent organs

T3a: tumor extends <1 mm beyond muscularis propria 4

T3b: tumor extends 1-5 mm beyond muscularis propria 4

T3c: tumor extends 5-15 mm beyond muscularis propria 4

T3d: tumor extends 15 mm beyond muscularis propria 4

T4: tumor invades directly into other organs or structures and/or perforates visceral peritoneum

T4a: tumor penetrates to the surface of the visceral peritoneum

T4b: tumor directly invades or is adherent to other organs or structures

Assessing T3 disease, it is important to remember that desmoplastic reaction can mimic this due to fibrosis; however, desmoplastic reaction has a spiky and sharp configuration whereas tumor usually has a nodular and lumpy configuration.

The planes that the small field-of-view axial and coronal sequences have been acquired in should be carefully scrutinised; obliquity may lead to overstaging of tumors due to apparent transgression of tumor through the muscularis propria, but that is in fact an artifact of the plane and volume averaging.

The distance from the invasive margin of the tumor (T3 disease) to the mesorectal fascia is important in guiding resection and the need for preoperative chemo-radiotherapy.

Regional lymph nodes (N)
Signal heterogeneity and irregular contour are the most reliable signs of nodal involvement on MRI. Size is not considered to be a very helpful criterion; up to 40%% of nodes under 5 mm contain tumor.

Nx: regional nodes cannot be assessed

N0: no regional lymph node metastases

N1: metastasis in 1-3 regional (perirectal) lymph nodes

N1a: metastasis in 1 regional lymph node

N1b: metastasis in 2-3 regional lymph nodes

N1c: tumor deposit(s) in the subserosa, mesentery, or non-peritonealised pericolic or perirectal tissues without regional nodal metastasis

N2: metastasis in 4 or more regional lymph nodes

N2a: metastasis in 4-6 regional lymph nodes

N2b: metastasis in 7 or more regional lymph nodes

It should be noted that there is controversy over whether nodes in the pelvic sidewall are regional or non-regional nodes. A multicenter study found that nodes greater than 7 mm within the pelvic sidewalls rendered a greater possibility of recurrence if treatment was just chemoradiotherapy and rectal cancer surgery, and no pelvic sidewall dissection 12.

Metastases (M)
Mx: cannot be assessed

M0: no distant metastasis

M1: distant metastasis

M1a: metastasis confined to one organ or site (for example, liver, lung, ovary, non-regional node) without peritoneal metastases

M1b: metastases in more than one organ

M1c: metastasis to the peritoneum with or without other organ involvement

Differential Diagnosis
Vasitis nodosa
Inguinal hernia
Postoperative hematoma
Soft-tissue neoplasm
Case Points
Sperm granuloma is a postoperative complication of vasectomy, usually presenting after 3 weeks.
Sperm granuloma most often presents as a painless nodule; only 2%% to 3%% of patients have symptomatic sperm granulomas. They are noted in 15%% to 40%% of vasectomy patients at reversal and are bilateral in 8%%.
Ultrasound findings of sperm granuloma include hypoechoic nodule with punctate calcifications and mild internal vascularity.

Discussion
Sperm granuloma is a relatively common complication following vasectomy procedures. While only 2%% to 3%% of patients present with painful sperm granuloma following vasectomy, many patients notice a painless lump. Sperm granulomas are noted at 15%% to 40%% of vasectomy reversal procedures. At 8%% of reversal procedures, these are noted to be bilateral. There is a correlation between presence of sperm granuloma and success of reversal procedure. Likewise, there is an inverse correlation with congestive epididymitis. It is theorized that the sperm granuloma allows the epididymis to decompress in the immediate postsurgical period, thus decreasing congestion.
On ultrasound, sperm granuloma may appear as a hypoechoic, mildly heterogeneous extratesticular lesion. There may be punctate echogenic foci, which represent calcifications. Mild internal vascularity is often present. Sperm granuloma should not be confused with neoplastic or infectious processes. The patient may be reassured that this is a relatively common finding after vasectomy and that the nodules have no malignant potential. In rare cases, persistently painful sperm granuloma may necessitate reversal of vasectomy. Vasitis nodosa is a closely related postvasectomy complication, consisting of benign proliferation of the ductal structures immediately following surgical intervention. This presents as a focal thickening of the vas. Like sperm granuloma, it is common and may be mistaken for malignancy",SCROTUM - HYPOECHOIC NODULE - ULTRASOUND
